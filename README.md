A small API created using Fast-API Framework where the user can post in JSON format and also retrieve/get all the posts of other users as well as delete and update their own posts. These are all stored in a Postgres 
SQL Database which is one of the largest open-source database. Worked on different libraries for connecting the Fast-API to SQL Server like SQL ALchemy and Alembic.
